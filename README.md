# PHP-Version-Switch-Ubuntu
This is a little .sh script interface that allow switch between PHP 5 and PHP 7 versions on Ubuntu Distros(Under 14.04), executed on your terminal.

## First Step
The switcher currently changes between ***PHP 5*** and ***PHP 7***, for that reason that two version need to be installed on your system. You can found there the installation steps of [PHP 7.0 (and 5.6) on Ubuntu](https://lornajane.net/posts/2016/php-7-0-and-5-6-on-ubuntu).
 
But to be more on point I recommend follow [THIS ONE](https://askubuntu.com/questions/761713/how-can-i-downgrade-from-php-7-to-php-5-6-on-ubuntu-16-04/762161#762161)

## Second Step
Download the file and execute it as a normal .sh on your computer

### How to execute a "***normal .sh***" on my computer???
First at all open your terminal and locate the downloaded file on your computer, then runs the next.

``chmod +x PHP-Switcher.sh``

``./PHP-Switcher.sh``

If you have troubles with the permissions try to execute it as superuser:

``sudo chmod +x PHP-Switcher.sh``

``sudo ./PHP-Switcher.sh``

## Third Step
Select your option and enjoy this little helper
